constraint_agent.py

- Uses LLM to determine if a student meets prequisites for a course. 
- Uses credit to determine if a student's current standing suits a course's level. I.E. 15 credit freshmen shouldn't be recommended 300/400 level courses.
- Uses penalties (0 - 0.6) so PlanningAgent can down-rank courses because of credit standing but, still recommend them. 
- Still works without missing transcript information, but can give better recommendations with it (clarifying question posed by orchestrator can collect information). 

Credit Standings for Rutgers:
- Freshman: 0-29 credits -> should be recommended mostly 100/200 level courses, with some 300/400 if they have AP/transfer credits or are doing well.
- Sophomore: 30-59 credits -> can be recommended more 200/300 level courses, with stronger emphasis toward level 200 courses. 
- Junior: 60-89 credits -> can be recommended 300 level courses, with some 400 if they have strong performance and relevant completed courses.
- Senior: 90+ credits -> can be recommended any of the four levels, with stronger emphasis on 300/400 level courses.

Penalty Score Explanation(Subject to change or tuning): 
- 0.0: No penalty, fully meets prerequisites and is appropriate for standing
- 0.15: One tier below recommended stadnding. 
- 0.35: Two tiers below recommended standing.
- 0.6: Three or more tiers below recommended standing.
