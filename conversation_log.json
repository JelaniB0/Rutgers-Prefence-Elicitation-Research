          "response": "That's wonderful to hear that you're interested in working with large datasets and exploring data science! Since you're a sophomore, this is the perfect time to build foundational skills while diving deeper into data-related topics. I've pulled together courses that align with your goals and ranked my top 5 recommendations just for you. Here they are:\n\n---\n\n### **#1 - 01:198:439: Introduction to Data Science (NB)**\nThis course is perfect for kicking off your journey in data science! It covers the essential tools and techniques needed to solve data-driven problems, like data preparation, analysis, and real-world applications. It\u2019s comprehensive while still being accessible.  \n**Why it\u2019s great for you:**  \n- It offers a well-rounded introduction to the field of data science.  \n- You'll learn skills that are directly applicable to working with large datasets and solving real-world problems.  \n- It's a great way to start building knowledge that will help you in more advanced coursework later.  \n\n*Note:* This is a 400-level course, so keep in mind it might have prerequisites\u2014we can double-check those later!\n\n---\n\n### **#2 - 01:198:210: Data Management for Data Science (NB)**  \nThis course focuses on the nuts and bolts of organizing and handling data. If you\u2019re working with large datasets, understanding how to manage and store data efficiently is a must, and this course will teach you to wrangle real-world data and introduce you to databases.  \n**Why it\u2019s great for you:**  \n- It\u2019s super practical and gives you hands-on experience with database management.  \n- The skills you\u2019ll gain here are fundamental for any data science career.  \n- It\u2019s tuned to the knowledge level of sophomores, so it\u2019s a perfect next step for you!\n\n---\n\n### **#3 - 01:198:336: Principles of Information and Data Management (NB)**  \nThis course dives into how to represent and analyze data, especially when working with databases. It also covers more advanced ideas like information integration and patterns within data. It\u2019s an excellent fit if you want to expand your analytical skills while working on database-heavy concepts.  \n**Why it\u2019s great for you:**  \n- It strengthens your understanding of how to work with databases, which is crucial for handling large datasets.  \n- You\u2019ll also explore slightly more advanced topics, giving you a nice combination of challenge and reward at your level.  \n- This is another step to prepare for the exciting possibilities in data science.  \n\n---\n\n### **#4 - 01:960:486: Applied Statistical Learning (NB)**  \nData science relies heavily on understanding the numbers behind the data. This course focuses on the statistics and analysis techniques you\u2019ll need to effectively work with data, from time-series to multivariate analysis. While it might require some background in statistics, this is the kind of knowledge that will pay off as you move forward.  \n**Why it\u2019s great for you:**  \n- Statistical skills are a must for working with large datasets, and you\u2019ll gain a strong understanding here.  \n- You\u2019ll use practical, computer-based techniques to analyze real-world data\u2014exactly the kind of experience a data scientist needs!  \n- It\u2019s a logical next step after learning fundamental data manipulation.  \n\n*Note:* This course also has prerequisites, so we'll need to look into those.\n\n---\n\n### **#5 - 01:198:112: Data Structures**  \nThis course might seem more general, but trust me, it\u2019s absolutely essential for anyone diving into data science. It\u2019s all about how data is organized, sorted, and searched\u2014skills that are core to everything else in the field.  \n**Why it\u2019s great for you:**  \n- It gives you a strong foundation in understanding how data works.  \n- These skills are directly applicable to advanced concepts like algorithms, machine learning, and data manipulation.  \n- Many upper-level data science and computer science courses will build on this knowledge, so it\u2019s a perfect addition to your schedule.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\nLet me know which of these courses stands out to you, or if you\u2019d like more details on any of them! Since I can\u2019t yet confirm if you meet the prerequisites for some of these (like the 400-level courses), we\u2019ll want to double-check those when planning your schedule.  \n\nI\u2019m here to help you make the best choices, and I know you\u2019re on the right track toward a successful path in data science. Let\u2019s figure out your next steps together! Are any of these a good fit for your goals?"
