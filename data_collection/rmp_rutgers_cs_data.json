As long as you have a pulse, you'll get at least a B, but don't expect to learn anything in this course. Exams are unnecessarily difficult, and academic honesty is never rewarded. I'd recommend going to lectures if you have trouble falling asleep."

The class does have a lot of work in the forms of homework and multiple projects though. He can also be disorganized, but he makes up for it with his willingness to help."

Maybe I'm just a masochist, but I found her a lot easier to deal with as the semester wore on. If you don't participate, you will not only fail, but you will probably be accosted at every turn. Don't try cheating. She will literally tear you to shreds."

Though his approach to teaching the material was initially iffy for me, I found that the space he gives us to learn the materials ourselves through hands-on experience was in the end, super worthwhile. Super responsive and helpful as well as empathetic and lenient. Treated everyone like adults. 5/5"

He has a lot of knowledge and can help if you talk 1to1 but his lectures are not very helpful. Before the lockdown, his classes were useless, more so after. Ridiculous extra credit project, pray for a good TA!"

He provides excellent Powerpoint slides which can be used later to study.  Only gripe with the course overall (not him) is that exams aren't taken directly from most lectures.  Great professor!"
