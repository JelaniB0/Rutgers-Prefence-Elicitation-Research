        {courses_json}


        TASK: Select and rank the TOP {max_results} courses for this student.

        HARD RULES — apply these before anything else:
        1. DEDUPLICATION: If multiple courses share the same title (e.g. several sections
        of "Topics in Computer Science"), include AT MOST ONE. Pick the single section
        whose description best matches the student's interests. Exclude all others entirely —
        do not list them in ranked_courses or not_recommended.

        2. SPECIFICITY OVER GENERICITY: A course with a specific description that directly
        mentions the student's stated interests always ranks ABOVE a course with a vague
        or variable description (e.g. "Topics in X", "Special Topics"), even if the generic
        course has no prerequisites. Do not assume a generic course covers the student's
        interests just because its description is broad.

        3. PREREQUISITE GAPS — never silently drop a relevant course. If a course is relevant
        to the student's interests but prerequisites are unmet, include it in the ranking
        below eligible courses of similar relevance. Explain clearly what is missing and
        what the student needs to take first.

        4. STANDING PENALTY: Courses with standing_penalty > 0 rank below penalty-free courses
        of similar relevance. The higher the penalty (max 0.6), the further it drops.

        5. RELEVANCE ALWAYS WINS: Never replace a relevant but ineligible course with an
        irrelevant eligible one just to fill the list. A relevant course with unmet
        prerequisites is always preferable to an irrelevant course the student can take now.

        6. BLOCKED BUT RELEVANT + ASSUMPTIONS:
        - If a transcript IS available and a course would rank in the top 3 based on interest
            match alone but has unmet prerequisites, do NOT place it in ranked_courses. Instead,
            place it in not_recommended with:
            - would_rank: where it would have placed if eligible
            - blocked_by: the specific missing prerequisite codes
            - pathway: a concrete 1-2 sentence action plan to become eligible
        - If NO transcript is available, do not assume anything about the student's experience
            level, completed courses, or eligibility. Only rank courses based on how well they
            match the student's stated interests. Do not pad the list with foundational or
            introductory courses unless the student explicitly asks for beginner content.
            Note prerequisites for each course but do not block or penalize any course for
            eligibility reasons since eligibility cannot be verified. Also don't generate the 1-2 sentences,
            skip that entire since you know nothing about student.  

        RANKING CRITERIA (applied after hard rules, in order of priority):
        1. How explicitly the course description matches the student's stated interests
        — vague or indirect matches rank lower than direct matches
        2. Prerequisite eligibility — eligible courses rank above ineligible ones of equal relevance
        3. Year and standing appropriateness
        4. Learning value and skill development toward career path
        5. Student difficulty and GPA preferences

        For each ranked course, reasoning must:
        - Explain specifically how the course content matches this student's interests
        - State whether it is immediately available or has prerequisite/standing gaps
        - If a constraint affected the ranking, say so explicitly and constructively
