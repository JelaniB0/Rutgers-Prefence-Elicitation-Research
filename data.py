Some initial ideas on what data, resources, and tools could be used for CS course preference elicitation research:
1. Publicly available datasets on student preferences, course evaluations, etc.
2. University course catalogs and syllabi.
3. Course Navigator data from Rutgers (possibly).
4. Surveys or interviews with students about their course preferences.
5. Academic performance data (grades, completion rates, transcripts) if accessible.
6. Course level data (difficulty of course, course level, prereqs, student credit standing).

Things to be done: 
1. Identify and gather relevant datasets (though small for course preferences).
2. Potentially create data sets through surveys or interviews.
3. Find ways to access/utilize course catalog, navigator, and academic factors.
